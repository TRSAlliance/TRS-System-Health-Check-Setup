The following `npm` commands configure package scripts for health checks: `npm pkg set scripts.health="node scripts/health-check.js"`, `npm pkg set scripts.health:watch="nodemon scripts/health-check.js"`, and `npm pkg set scripts.health:ci="node scripts/health-check.js --json"`. These are equivalent to the following `package.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "health": "node scripts/health-check.js",
    "health:watch": "nodemon scripts/health-check.js",
    "health:ci": "node scripts/health-check.js --json"
  }
}
```
